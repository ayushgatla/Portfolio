# Ayush Gatla’s Personal Portfolio

*(Because “Another Developer” was already taken.)*

##  Overview

This is my flashy personal portfolio (hosted at [**portfolio-kappa-indol-14.vercel.app**](https://portfolio-kappa-indol-14.vercel.app)) — showcasing my mad HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills, sprinkled with awesome visuals.

##  Features

- **Landing Page**: Bold visuals with background images to slap the viewer awake.
- **Tech Icons**: Icons for C, C++, Java, Python, Blockchain, After Effects, etc. (I’m basically a one-person DevCon.)
- **Interactive Sections**: Sections pop, backgrounds shift, and maybe a JS trick or two hides behind.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks stunning on phone, tablet, and surprisingly on that old laptop someone found in their attic.

##  Built With

- HTML – because who doesn’t love markup?
- CSS – the style wizard behind the curtains.
- JavaScript – the sprinkle of chaos that makes everything interactive.
- Bonus: Some *fine* images (jpg, png) for backgrounds, icons, and headshots, because coding only makes sense with visuals.
